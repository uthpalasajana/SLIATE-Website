Message from the Director General
Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological 
Education (SLIATE) is dedicated to provide 
quality higher education along with good 
character. I am extremely happy to state that 
the academics, professionals and management 
staff of the institution offer their services to 
develop the curriculum, build up the skills and 
knowledge and provide training to our students. With the 
corporation that is given by the state, I am certain that our attempt 
at producing quality diploma holders will be a great success.
The Student Handbook is published with the intention of 
governing the students with the appropriate rules and regulations 
of the institute. The key highlights in the Handbook include 
programme and course requirements, academic advancement, 
examinations issues as well as general rules and regulations 
governing students’ code of conduct and discipline. Every student 
is expected to read and understand the contents of the “Student 
Handbook” so as to avoid pitfalls in life which can be very costly 
at times. We urge you to be our ambassadors wherever you are in 
dressing and behavior.
I have no doubt that you all would make the best use of the 
academic life and emerge as a competent human resource and 
fulfill the expectations of your beloved parents and the nation.

5.11 Grade Point Average
Grade Point Average (GPA) is the credit-weighted arithmetic 
mean of the Grade Point Values and the GPA is determined by 
dividing the total credit- weighted Grade Point Value by the 
total number of credits.
GPA = ∑(ni*gi)
∑ni
Student Handbook of SLIATE
32
Where ni is the number of credits for the i
th module in a 
given semester and gi is the grade points earned for that 
module. GPA is rounded to the nearest second decimal 
place.
For example, a candidate who has completed five course 
units each of four credits and two course units each of two 
credits with grades A, C, B+, D, C+ and B, A+ 
respectively.
The GPA would be as follows:
= (4 x 4.0)+(4 x 2.0)+(4 x 3.3)+(4 x 1.0)+(4 x 2.3)+(2 x 3.0)+ 2 x 4.0)
(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2)
= 16.0 + 8.0 + 13.2 + 4.0 + 9.2 + 6.0 + 8.0
24
= 64.4
24
= 2.6833
= 2.68
